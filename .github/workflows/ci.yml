# Continuous Integration: making sure the codebase works
# ======================================================

# This workflow tests modifications to 'kmip2pkcs11', ensuring that the daemon
# can be used by others successfully. It verifies certain aspects of the
# codebase, such as the formatting and feature flag combinations, and runs the
# full test suite. It runs on Ubuntu.

name: CI

# When the workflow runs
# ----------------------
on:
  # Execute when a pull request is (re-) opened or its head changes (e.g. new
  # commits are added or the commit history is rewritten) ... but only if
  # build-related files change.
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - '**.rs'
      - 'Cargo.toml'
      - 'Cargo.lock'
      - '.github/workflows/ci.yml'

  # If a pull request is merged, at least one commit is added to the target
  # branch. If the target is another pull request, it will be caught by the
  # above event. We miss PRs that merge to a non-PR branch, except for the
  # 'main' branch.

  # Execute when a commit is pushed to 'main' (including merged PRs) or to a
  # release tag ... but only if build-related files change.
  push:
    branches:
      - 'main'
      - 'releases/**'
    paths:
      - '**.rs'
      - 'Cargo.toml'
      - 'Cargo.lock'
      - '.github/workflows/ci.yml'

  # Rebuild 'main' every week. This will account for changes to dependencies
  # and to Rust, either of which can trigger new failures. Rust releases are
  # every 6 weeks, on a Thursday; this event runs every Friday.

# Jobs
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  # Check Formatting
  # ----------------
  #
  # NOTE: This job is run even if no '.rs' files have changed. Inserting such
  # a check would require using a separate workflow file or using third-party
  # actions. Most commits do change '.rs' files, and 'cargo-fmt' is pretty
  # fast, so optimizing this is not necessary.

  # Determine MSRV
  # --------------

  # The MSRV needs to be determined as we will test 'kmip2pkcs11' against the
  # Rust compiler at that version.

  # Check Feature Flags
  # -------------------
  #
  # Rust does not provide any way to check that all possible feature flag
  # combinations will succeed, so we need to try them manually here. We will
  # assume this choice is not influenced by the OS or Rust version.

  # Clippy
  # ------
  #
  # We run Clippy separately, and only on nightly Rust because it offers a
  # superset of the lints.
  #
  # 'cargo clippy' and 'cargo build' can share some state for fast execution,
  # but it's faster to execute them in parallel than to establish an ordering
  # between them.
